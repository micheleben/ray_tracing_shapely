    The base class for glasses.

    Attributes:
        refIndex: The refractive index of the glass, or the Cauchy coefficient A
                  of the glass if "Simulate Colors" is on.
        cauchyB: The Cauchy coefficient B of the glass if "Simulate Colors" is on,
                 in micrometer squared.

    Notes:
        - The `merges_with_glass` property is set to True for all glass objects
        - Implements Snell's law for refraction and Fresnel equations for reflection
        - Supports surface merging with other glasses for complex optical systems
        - Handles both normal and negative refractive indices
    Features:
        - Refractive index handling (including Cauchy's equation for dispersion)
        - Snell's law implementation for refraction
        - Fresnel equations for reflection coefficients
        - Surface merging for complex optical systems
        - Support for negative refractive indices
        - Adaptive ray sampling for dim rays
    key features:
        - Dispersion modeling: Uses Cauchy's equation n(λ) = A + B/λ² to model wavelength-dependent refractive index
        - Fresnel reflection: Correctly calculates s- and p-polarized reflection coefficients
        - Total internal reflection: Handles cases where refraction is impossible
        - Adaptive sampling: For very dim reflected rays, uses statistical sampling to reduce ray count while preserving energy

              Secondary reflected rays (from Fresnel reflection) are in 'newRays'.

              The caller should NOT continue tracing the incident ray, but should
              trace any secondary rays.
